## Course Overview

This course is a study in methods for deriving information from and making decisions based on limited or noisy data.
In the information age, large amounts of data are created on a near-constant basis.
Unfortunately, the sources of this data are often of low quality compared to the controlled studies for which simple statistical inference techniques are effective.
In order to exploit this abundance, we require methods to incorporate data into our models and decisions while accounting for the uncertainty introduced by this "noisy" data.
Many of these tools can be understood in terms of *conditional probability*.

The course will begin with mathematical preliminaries, including set theory and Boolean algebra, the basics of mathematical reasoning, combinatorics, and discrete and continuous probability spaces.
After this, we will use these tools for a careful study of conditional probiability, with an emphasis on the use of Bayes' theorem.
Finally, we will explore several applications for modeling random scenarios, including Markov chains, information theory, and decision theory.

### Prerequisites

In this course, we expect a basic knowledge of probability and statistics, at the level of ISTA 116, MATH 263, or similar.
We also expect Python programming at the level of ISTA 130 or another introductory course.
Experience with logical reasoning will be helpful, but we do not assume any previous knowledge in this area.

If you do not meet these prerequisitez, but believe you have sufficient preparation to enroll, please contact me to discuss in person.

## Required work

### Readings

Our principal source for this course will be the course notes created by Colin Reimer Dawson.
Readings from these notes will be assigned on a daily basis.
Occasionally, additional readings may be assigned from other sources, such as journal articles.

#### Recommended readings

The following are not required readings, but offer a different perspective on the ideas we are engaging with in the course.

* Allen B. Downey, *Think Bayes*. This is a book on Bayesian statistics and estimation written from computational perspective rather than a mathematical one. If you are more comfortable thinking about probability using Python than using mathematics, this book may help you understand the course material better.
* Daniel Kahneman, *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. This is not a bookon probability or statistics, but rather a book on human cognition, derived from the behavioral reseorch that earned the author the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics. A recurring theme in the book is the inability of certain cognitive modes to correctly process statistical information, particularly information pertaining to conditional probabilities. Since we all are required to approach this subject through our own human cognitive abilities, it is enlightening to understand where and how the weaknesses of those abilities may affect us.
