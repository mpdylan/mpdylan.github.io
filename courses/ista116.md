# ISTA 116: Statistical Foundations for the Informatian Age



## Course Overview

This course is an introduction to statistics, covering
* Data collection
* Summary statistics and data visualization
* Elementary probability theory
* Parameter estimation by confidence intervals
* Hypothesis tests for means and proportions
* Linear and logistic regression

In addition to statistics, this course serves as an introduction to the R programming language and the associated RStudio development environment.

## Prerequisites and required technology

This course requires a basic competency in algebra and familiarity with elementary functions, such as square roots and logarithms. This can be demonstrated by course credit in MATH 112 (College Algebra) or a sufficient score on the mathematics placement exam.

Programming experience is not required for this course, but if this is your first experience with a programming language, be aware that you will probably have to take some extra time toward the beginning of the course to gain the skill of thinking programmatically.
It is important that you don't fall behind on this aspect of the course, as the complexity of tasks increases as the course progresses.

It is strongly recommended that you have a computer capable of running R and RStudio, so that you are able to complete assignments outside of the lab period.
R and RStudio run on Windows, Mac, and several distributions of Linux, but notably *not* on Chrome OS.
If you use a Chromebook and you wish to run R, you must install Linux on it.

## Attendance policy

Attendance is expected at all course meetings and lab sections.
Lab attendance is factored directly into your grade, and class attendance is required to complete the in-class quizzes.

## Assignments

Submitted assignments in this course consist of 14 lab assignments, which are submitted in the form of R scripts.
Each week you will be in the lab for a 2 hour session, where there will be a short presentation by your section leader, after which you will have time to work on the lab in a pair with another student.

Attendance at lab sessions is required and accounts for a substantial portion of your grade.
In order to be considered to have attended the lab, you must sign in at the beginning of lab and then work on the lab until you and your partner have completed the lab or the period is over.
If you would like to leave early, you must show your section leader your completed lab and get it approved by them.

Here are a few examples of behavior that will *not* earn you attendance credit:
* Showing up to the lab section, signing in, and immediately leaving
* Showing up to the lab section, signing in, and then doing something besides working on the lab for the entire period
* Showing up to the lab section with the lab already completed and immediately leaving, while your partner has not yet completed the lab

Generally, lab assignments will be due one week after the corresponding lab section.

## Grading policies

The grade breakdown is as follows:
* Lab assignments: 14 * 2% = 28%
* Lab attendance: 14 * 1% = 14%
* In-class quizzes: 18%
* Exams: 2 * 20% = 40%

## Academic Honesty

You are expected to abide by all University policies regarding academic honesty.

Specific to this course: it is encouraged that you work together with your fellow students on labs. However, we ask that you:
* cite your fellow students as "collaborators" in the header of your lab file
* do not simply copy code wholesale from other students

Failing to cite your collaborators or copying code straight from other students may result in loss of credit for the assignment or formal Academic Integrity proceedings.
