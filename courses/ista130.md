## Course Overview

This course is an introduction to algorithmic thinking and computer programming using the Python programming language. 
We will cover structural concepts of programming and computational problem solving, as well as core Python techniques and data structures, including strings, lists, dictionaries and classes.

### Who this course is for

If you have little or no prior experience in programming, this course is for you. 
If you have substantial prior experience in programming, then this course is probably not for you (even if you are unfamiliar with Python specifically). 
If you have such experience, please contact the instructor to discuss a better course for you to take.

### Prerequisites
The prerequisite for this course is math at the level of MATH 112 (College Algebra). 
Students who have not completed MATH 112 with a grade of C or better may enroll with the permission of the instructor; please contact me.

### Technical requirements

This course requires you to write and execute Python code. 
As such, you will need a computer that can run Python. 
This generally means a computer running a conventional desktop/laptop operating system, such as Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. 

Occasionally, students want to take this course using a Chromebook.
This is not impossible, but will require extra steps.
My recommendation is to obtain an instance on a cloud service such as Amazon Web Services.
If you would like to do this, contact me and I can explain the basic steps.
