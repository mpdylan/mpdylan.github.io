##Changing variables and changing perspectives

Solving a problem in physics invariably comes down to finding the best coordinates -- the best perspective for viewing the system we are trying to describe.
Introductory students encounter this in answering the question of how to describe the motion of a block sliding down a ramp.
If we think of positions in the horizontal and the vertical, then we have to keep track of two different motions at once.
But the problem is made simple and the solution made clear by merely rotating the coordinates -- tilting our heads to the side until the ramp looks horizontal.

What this simple example exposes is that our initial viewpoint as observers is not always the best way to look at the world.
Choosing an angle that centers the objects we are trying to study simplifies and clarifies the 

### The Motion of Planets

The idea of changing perspective 
Imagine trying to describe the motion of a planet around the sun.
If we try to look from the outside and keep track of how each object is moving, we will be hopelessly lost, or at least badly confused.
We need to keep track of three coordinates, \\(x, y, z\\) for each of the two objects.
They are each pulling on one another in a direction that is constantly turning, and with a force that is constantly varying from stronger to weaker and back as the two bodies move closer and further apart.
There is so much to keep track of!

But if we let go of our fixed, outside perspective, we can greatly simplify the problem.
The planet does not "know" where it is from our outside perspective; all it can see is how far away the sun is, and in which direction it lies.


But what if the best viewpoint on the system is not always the same?

### 



The two-body problem has a comforting simplicity to it: regardless of the size of the planet and the sun, regardless of how near or far they begin or how fast each is moving, the coordinates that reveal the structure of the system are always the same.
The details may vary, but the overall picture never varies.
But the systems I study do not have this simplicity; the variety of possible solutions and behaviors is wider.
Perspectives that allow us to completely solve the equations in one situation may not even make sense to write down in another.

The goal of this program of research is to unify two of these seemingly disparate perspectives.
