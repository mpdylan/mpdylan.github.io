This is a brief overview of some of my active projects on GitHub. Most are research related, at least tangentially, but there are a few exceptions.
Also, there are several more repositories on my GitHub--many of these are just whims and larks that I never followed up on, alas.

### Floquet.jl

#### Language: Julia ####

A collection of functions for numerically investigating Floquet theory for Schroedinger operators on the real line, as well as for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and real line. Includes routines for the computation of Floquet discriminants, transfer matrices, and analogues of the Baker-Akheizer functions.
