This is a brief overview of some of my active projects on GitHub. Most are research related, at least tangentially, but there are a few exceptions.
Also, there are several more repositories on my GitHub--many of these are just whims and larks that I never followed up on, alas.

### Measures

#### Language: C++ ####

#### Status: preliminary ####

A collection of functions for studying probability measures on the real line and the unit circle via their associated orthogonal polynomials and recurrence coefficients, including discrete dynamical systems governing those coefficients where applicable. Includes support for arbitrary-precision computations.

### Polytopes.jl

#### Language: Julia ####

#### Status: preliminary ####

A module for manipulation of and computation with convex and non-convex polytopes in arbitrary dimension, with applications to computational and combinatorial geometry and linear programming.

### Floquet.jl

#### Language: Julia ####

#### Status: basic functionality ####

A collection of functions for numerically investigating Floquet theory for Schroedinger operators on the real line, as well as for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and real line. Includes routines for the computation of Floquet discriminants, transfer matrices, and analogues of the Baker-Akheizer functions.

Currently, I'm also adding support for "commutation methods" (Darboux transformations) for Jacobi operators.

### NFLML.jl

#### Language: Julia ####

#### Status: not even preliminary, still just a goofy idea ####

A library to help me crush my next fantasy football league by applying statistical machine learning and data assimilation techniques to play-by-play data from NFL Game Center.
