I am a Ph.D. candidate under [Nicholas Ercolani](http://math.arizona.edu/~ercolani) in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arizona, and a lecturer in the School of Information.
My current research focuses on the spectral geometry of discrete integrable systems, including discrete Schroedinger operators and the recurrence relations associated with orthogonal polynomials.
I am also interested in the application of these results to questions in random matrix theory and statistical mechanics.

I also work on machine learning and optical character recognition, on a project led by Marek Rychlik and Yan Han.
We are developing improved OCR algorithms and techniques for currently under-served languages, with the Afghan Data collection of documents in Pashto and Dari held by the University of Arizona library serving as an initial target for digitization.
This work is partially supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

At the School of Information, I teach several courses in introductory and intermediate probability and statistics.
