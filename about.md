I'm a Ph.D. candidate under [Nicholas Ercolani](http://math.arizona.edu/~ercolani) in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arizona.
My current research focuses on discrete integrable systems such as the Toda lattice equations.
I am also interested in the application of scattering-theoretic techniques to questions orthogonal polynomial theory and random matrix theory.

This website covers my professional work as a mathematician.
Other projects can be found at my personal website, [Cotangent Space](http://cotangent.space).
