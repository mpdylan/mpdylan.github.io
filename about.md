I am a Ph.D. candidate under [Nicholas Ercolani](http://math.arizona.edu/~ercolani) in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arizona.
My current research focuses on the spectral geometry of discrete integrable systems, including discrete Schroedinger operators and the recurrence relations associated with orthogonal polynomials.
I am also interested in the application of these results to questions random matrix theory and statistical mechanics.

This is my professional website; other projects can be found at my personal website, [Cotangent Space](http://cotangent.space) (coming soon!).
