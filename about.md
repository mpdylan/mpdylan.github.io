I am a Ph.D. candidate under [Nicholas Ercolani](http://math.arizona.edu/~ercolani) in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arizona.
My current research focuses on the spectral geometry of discrete integrable systems, including discrete Schroedinger operators and the recurrence relations associated with orthogonal polynomials.
I am also interested in the application of these results to questions in random matrix theory and statistical mechanics.

I have also recently started a project with Marek Rychlik, Mohammad Moussa, and Yan Han, working on OCR and metadata extraction for documents currently underserved by these technologies, including text in languages such as Pashto and Traditional Chinese, as well as documents containing mathematical formulas or tabular data.

Some of my non-mathematical projects can be found at my personal website, [Cotangent Space](http://cotangent.space) (coming soon!).
