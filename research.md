## Discrete Schroedinger operators

My current research focuses on discrete Schroedinger operators.
These are an integer-lattice discretization of the familiar Schroedinger operator \(Q = \partial^2 + q(x)\) and can be regarded as finite or infinite tridiagonal matrices.
Half-line discrete Schroedinger operators are intimately connected with orthogonal polynomials on the real line, through the well-known three-term recurrence relation which is expressed as a tridiagonal matrix.

#### Floquet theory

Mumford and van Moerbeke established a 1:1 correspondence between a broad class of periodic difference operators (including discrete Schroedinger operators) and algebraic curves which encode the spectrum of these operators.
In the hyperelliptic case, this makes a nice analogy for the spectral curves associated to Korteweg-de Vries equations with periodic inital data.
I am working on constructing the correct geometric analogue of the scattering-class operators from the KdV equation in the discrete setting of Mumford and van Moerbeke.

#### Scattering limits 

#### Discrete Darboux transformations

The Darboux transformation is a method for producing, from a beginning operator \(Q = \partial^2 + q(x)\) and a known solution to the equation \(Qf = \lambda f\), a new operator \(\tilde Q = \partial^2 + \tilde q(x)\) and function \(\tilde f\) satisfying \(\tilde Q \tilde f = \lambda \tilde f\).
This transformation has gained recent attention for its ability to easily produce formulas for solutions to several soliton equations; the Lax equations associated to, for instance, the KdV equation are preserved under the Darboux transformation, so starting from a known solution to KdV one may apply the Darboux transformation and obtain a new solution to KdV.
Remarkably, even the trivial solution may be used as a starting point to construct nontrivial solutions, including the general multisoliton solution.

I am currently exploring an analog of this transformation in the discrete setting.
