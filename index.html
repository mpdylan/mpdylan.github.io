Hi! I'm Dylan Murphy. I'm a Bayesian statistician and one-time mathematician. I'm working as a baseball analyst for the Tampa Bay Rays.
I work on predictive models, mostly using R and Stan, and developing software tools to help my fellow sports nerds out.

Before this, I was a lecturer in the <a href="https://ischool.arizona.edu">University of Arizona School of Information</a>, where I
taught courses ranging from introductory statistics in R to graduate-level Bayesian modeling in Python with PyMC. I spend a bit of 
my free time following up on research I conducted for my dissertation with Nick Ercolani (also at Arizona) on integrable systems
and orthogonal polynomials. We are currently investigating how infinitesimal Darboux transformations performed on a tridiagonal operator
affect the measure of orthogonality associated to the polynomials generated by the operator's corresponding three-term recurrence
relation.

I don't update this page very often, but you can follow me <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@dylanm">on Mastodon</a> if you want to see what I'm up to.
