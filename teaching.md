### Teaching Experience
As a graduate student at the University of Arizona, I have taught a number of classes, including College Algebra, Precalculus, Calculus, and Statistics.
I am not currently teaching any courses; my most recent course was Math 263: Introduction to Statistics and Biostatistics in Spring 2016.
