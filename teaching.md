I am currently a Lecturer in the School of Information at the University of Arizona.
I teach courses primarily in the areas of probability, statistics (including Bayesian statistics), and programming in R and Python.

#### Current Schedule (Fall 2019)

* [ISTA 116: Statistical Foundations for the Information Age](/courses/ista116)
    * This introductory statistics course covers data collection principles, summary statistics, data visualization, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression, and the basics of R and RStudio.

* [ISTA 130: Computational Thinking and Doing](/courses/ista130)
    * This introductory-level course covers the basics of the Python programming language, introduced with no assumption of previous programming or computational experience. ISTA 130 serves as a foundation for more advanced courses in programming and data analysis, such as ISTA 131 and 330.

* [ISTA 311](/courses/ista311)
    * ISTA 311 is for students interested in Bayesian inference and methods for inference using limited or noisy data. After a brief review of probability theory and an introduction to the concept of probability as a form of belief, we cover Bayesian inference for categorical and numerical variables, model comparison,
