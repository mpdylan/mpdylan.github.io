I am currently a Lecturer in the School of Information at the University of Arizona.
I teach courses primarily in the areas of probability, statistics (including Bayesian statistics), and programming in R and Python.

#### Current Schedule (Fall 2020)

* ISTA 311: Foundations of Information and Inference
    * ISTA 311 is for students interested in Bayesian inference and methods for inference using limited or noisy data. After a brief review of probability theory and an introduction to the concept of probability as a form of belief, we cover Bayesian inference for categorical and numerical variables, model comparison, 

* ISTA 331: Principles and Practice of Data Science
	* This hands-on introduction to machine learning serves to introduce the core concepts and several example applications to students without requiring extensive mathematical background. Taught in Python using pandas, numpy/scipy, and sklearn, the course emphasizes careful reasoning about machine learning problems as well as the practical skills of data cleaning, model validation and testing, and deployment.

* ISTA 410 / INFO 510: Bayesian Modeling and Inference
	* This combined-section course, intended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students from a variety of backgrounds. It introduces modern methods in Bayesian modeling, inference by means of simulation, MCMC methods, hierarchical and graphical models, causal inference using DAGs, and several other topics.

#### Past Courses

* ISTA 116: Statistical Foundations for the Information Age
    * This introductory statistics course covers data collection principles, summary statistics, data visualization, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression, and the basics of R and RStudio.

* ISTA 130: Computational Thinking and Doing
    * This introductory-level course covers the basics of the Python programming language, introduced with no assumption of previous programming or computational experience. ISTA 130 serves as a foundation for more advanced courses in programming and data analysis, such as ISTA 131 and 330.
