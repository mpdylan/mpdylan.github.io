I am currently a Lecturer in the School of Information at the University of Arizona.
I teach courses primarily in the areas of probability, statistics (including Bayesian statistics), and programming in R and Python.

#### Current Schedule (Spring 2018)

* [ISTA 116: Statistical Foundations for the Information Age](/courses/ista116)
    * This introductory statistics course covers data collection principles, summary statistics, data visualization, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression. Calculations are performed using RStudio.

#### Future Teaching

* ISTA 116 (Fall 2018)
* [ISTA 130: Computational Thinking and Doing](/courses/ista130)
    * This course introduces students to the concepts of algorithmic thinking and the interpretation of computer programs using Python.
* [ISTA 311](/courses/ista311)
    * This intermediate course in probability and statistics introduces topics such as Bayesian estimation, information and coding theory, and Markov chains.
